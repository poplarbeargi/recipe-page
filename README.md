## My process
I start by assigning tags for the content inside the index.html first, doing so helps me to familiarise myself with each section. After that, I began to tinker and style the page with the CSS file. Nothing too fancy, I don't use Flexbox or grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

There was nothing too major when I created this, but it helped me hone my basic CSS and HTML, especially Media Query.
